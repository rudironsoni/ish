# Create GitHub Issue

## Step 1: Gather Information

Receive the issue topic from $ARGUMENTS or the user's description.

If the information is insufficient, ask the user to clarify the following:

- What needs to be done (the task or problem)
- Why it needs to be done (the purpose or motivation)

## Step 2: Research Context

Before writing the issue, investigate the relevant parts of the codebase to understand:

- Which files and modules are affected
- Existing related code patterns
- Potential impact and scope of the change

## Step 3: Draft the Issue

**Important: All issue content (title, body, labels) must be written in English**, regardless of the language used in the conversation with the user.

Create a well-structured issue with the following sections:

```markdown
## Summary

A concise one-liner describing what this issue is about.

## Motivation / Purpose

Why this change is needed. Explain the problem, user impact, or improvement opportunity.

## Details

Detailed description of what needs to be done:

- Specific changes required
- Files or modules likely affected
- Acceptance criteria or expected behavior

## Additional Context

Any relevant links, screenshots, or references (if applicable).
```

## Step 4: Assign Labels

First, get the available labels from the repository:

```bash
gh label list
```

Then choose appropriate labels from the existing repository labels based on the issue content. Also evaluate whether the issue is suitable for newcomers. If the contribution is straightforward (e.g., small scope, well-defined, minimal domain knowledge required), also assign the `good first issue` label if it exists in the repository.

## Step 5: Create the Issue

```bash
gh issue create --title "<concise title>" --body "<drafted body>" --label "<label1>,<label2>,..."
```

## Step 6: Report Result

Output the created issue URL and a summary of:

- Issue title
- Assigned labels
- Whether `good first issue` was applied and why (or why not)
